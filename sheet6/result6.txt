3b) (2.5p) Comments:  In your wallhack you can not walk ontop of walls anymore... you fall down (-0.5) everything else is good!
3c) (8.0p) Comments:  The Shellcode-Injection with NOPs does only work with enough luck and "weak" ASLR so you have to restart it several times... A better approach would have been the use of a "jmp esp" gadget so you do not need to know the real addresses of the stack ;) (-1) Your ROP-Chain works perfectly!
4a) (4.0p) Comments:  OK!
5a) (6.0p) Comments:  Works!
